There once was a tiefling named Torment.
He rolled a natural 20 on an attack roll.
Inside a wooden tavern.
He burned said tavern... down to the ground.

Torment felt bad about what he had done.
So he went to the poorer side of town.
And invested in a local bar.

He then named said bar...
The Burning Tavern.
